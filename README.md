## Installation

```sh
npm install @jackdbd/zod-schemas
```

## Development

Launch both the TypeScript compiler and the [Node.js test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) in watch mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build all TypeScript files with the TypeScript compiler, and all docs with [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) and [api-extractor + api-documenter](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/):

```sh
npm run build
```

You can also build the TypeScript files and the docs separately:

```sh
npm run build:ts
npm run docs
```

Whenever you change the public API of this project, you need to run api-extractor with the `--local` flag:

```sh
npx api-extractor run --config ./config/api-extractor.json --verbose --local
```

## Docs

Preview the documentation generated by TypeDoc:

```sh
npm run serve:docs
```

Note: it doesn't make much sense to preview the API docs generated by api-extractor + api-documenter. They are just a bunch of markdown files.
